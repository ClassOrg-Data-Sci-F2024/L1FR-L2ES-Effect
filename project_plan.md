Below is the plan for my project.

RQ: Does L1 French help L2 Spanish learners acquire the French periphrastic future better than L1 English?

I have chosen to analyze how L1 French affects L2 Spanish learners' acquisition of the periphrastic future in Spanish. The periphrastic future includes a subject + auxiliary verb + verb (infinitive), which is the same in both languages. I intend to use a corpus of written data taken from students who are learning the periphrastic future in their university beginner Spanish course. In order to answer my research question, I will maybe need a corpus with L1 English *and* L1 French speakers in order to make a proper comparison. Ideally, I would like to analyze university-level students, but I am willing to choose a different age group if there is not enough for the university-level age range. The study will have about 30 students with an L1 of Spanish. If unable to get enough learners, I will make sure there are sufficient tokens to analyze.  

I intend to include visualizations such as bar graphs to show the amount of L1 French and L1 English learners who accurately used the periphrastic future. The data could also be visualized as a scatter plot. This would be helpful in terms of correlation, aka showing the strength of the relationship between L1 and acqusition of the periphrastic future. These plots would involve using the ggplot2 package within tidyverse. Because I am looking at the causal relationship between the L1's and L2 Spanish, I would run a regression analysis. By running a regression, I am determining the strength of the relationship between the singular dependent variable (periphrastic future) and the two independent variables (L1 French and L1 English). If I remember correctly from Stats, I will need to use the `lm()` function from base R to perform the regression analysis.

Despite being an L1 Spanish speaker with a Bachelor's in French, I intend to include literature about both languages to supplement explanations on the grammar and acquisition of both languages. Below are some links and literature:
