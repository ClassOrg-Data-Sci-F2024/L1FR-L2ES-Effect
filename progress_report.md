Today I created the repository for my term project and added a README, LICENSE, project plan, and gitignore files.

I've decided to go with written corpora data analyzing L1 Spanish speakers' acquisition of paraphrastic future in L2 French.

Progress Report 1

The most important thing I wanted to focus on for this next step was finding a corpus that could work with the intended data, which I did! I had been having trouble finding one either with enough tokens, or one that included the L1 Spanish or L1 French learners that I was looking for. I encountered the CAES Corpus (Corpus de aprendices de espa√±ol / Corpus of Spanish learners) which so far has worked well. This corpus is comprised of written texts produced by L2 learners of Spanish of different backgrounds and proficiency levels.

Based on what has been found through some searches through the corpus, I intend to have the participants be L1 French speakers rather than L1 Spanish, because it is very hard to find corpora for French with L1 Spanish speakers. I initially intended to have the Spanish learners be beginner learners. This is because I believe it is best to analyze the participants' output prior to them acquiring more Spanish. This would be the best way to see what their starting knowledge is and how they are applying it during their acquisition, if at all. The only potential downfall is that there are only 58 tokens in total of just A1/Beginner participants, which may or may not be enough. I intend to consult Dan about this just to make sure prior to continuing.

Using L1 French speakers with all levels of proficiency, I have found a total of 146 tokens of the periphrastic future in Spanish, which is more than twice the amount of just beginners. If the 58 above are not enough, I will use the 146 tokens and analyze them that way. Regardless, this is still a small amount, and there are some tokens produced by the same participants.

If I am to do option two, I will group students by their proficiency levels and analyze them that way.


I also intend to use gender as an independent variable. There are 98 tokens for women and 58 tokens for men producing the periphrastic future based on what I have found. The 40-token difference may have the potential for skewed data, but I still need to go through and label all participants.

That is my next step. I have all of the tokens, but now I need to organize them by participants and see if there are any productions by the same participant.


Yining Nie has an article titled "TENSE AND MODALITY IN FRENCH VERBAL MORPHOLOGY" from 2015 that I intend to use as an explanation of the periphrastic future in French. This article also mentions the periphrastic future in Spanish, which is perfect for this project, since I initially explained that the two languages' periphrastic futures are the same, hence why I wanted to study any potential transfers from one language to another. If I need more scholarly references to back this up, I can certainly find more.

I intend to make it known that whatever results are found are more specific to those in the corpus and should not be generalized to all L1 French learners of Spanish.
